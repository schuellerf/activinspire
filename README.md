# Active Inspire

This is just an inofficial image to get https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/ActivInspire some how running

As this software has very outdated depenencies this image is based on Ubuntu 14.04
and needs lots of i386 libs...

# ia32-libs-dummy
I just created this dummy package with 
```
equivs-build ia32-libs-dummy
```
once on my PC just to get rid of the "legacy dependancy" to ia32-libs
